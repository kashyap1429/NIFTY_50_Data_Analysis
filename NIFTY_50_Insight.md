### **Insight:01**

In our analysis of the NIFTY 50 index focusing on monthly bullish trend probabilities, especially during the general election years of 2009, 2014, and 2019, we observed several key patterns:

- **Early March Peaks**: In election years, there's a significant peak in bullish trend probabilities during the early weeks of March. This is above the average when compared to other years where peaks are more common towards the end of March and the beginning of April.

- **Trend Duration**: Once a bullish trend begins, it typically lasts for around three months before it starts to decline or reverse. This suggests a window of opportunity for investors following the start of a bullish trend.

- **Election Year Fluctuations**: Major market fluctuations tend to occur approximately every three years, coinciding with election years. These fluctuations can be upwards or downwards, indicating heightened market volatility and investor uncertainty during these times.

- **Increased Bullish Probability**: During election years, the probability of a bullish trend, indicating potential market upswings, noticeably increases. For example:
  - In 2009, the bullish probability in October was 0.2631, which is relatively low.
  - By contrast, in 2014 and 2019, the probabilities rose to 0.5555 and 0.8, respectively, showing a marked increase in investor optimism or market momentum.

- **Additional Investment Windows**: Aside from the March peaks in election years, another period of interest is between mid-September and mid-November. This period also shows potential for market fluctuations, providing another strategic investment window.

- **Conclusion and Strategic Insight**:
  - The early weeks of March, particularly in election years, offer a high probability for bullish trends, signaling a favorable time for investment.
  - The period from September to mid-November also presents opportunities for market fluctuations, which, with careful analysis, could yield significant returns.
  - Observations from 2009, 2014, and 2019 highlight the impact of political events on market dynamics, emphasizing the importance of political awareness in investment strategy.


### **Insight:02**

In our study of the NIFTY 50 dataset, we delved into an innovative approach to forecasting daily trading range probabilities based on the opening value for the day (Open) and the average value from the previous day (Average). Here's a structured summary of our methodology and findings:

- **Data Preparation**:
  - We introduced a new column to hold the average of all rows, thus incorporating a historical perspective into our analysis.
  - We devised a formula to calculate the percentage change between the current day's opening value and the previous day's average, aiming to gauge the day-to-day volatility.

- **Formula for Percentage Change**:
  - Our key formula: `NEW(%) = ((Open - Average.shift(1)) / Average.shift(1)) * 100`
  - This formula calculates the relative change and expresses it as a percentage, serving as a basis for our predictive model.

- **Defining Range Bounds**:
  - With the derived percentages, we established a range by adding and subtracting a certain alpha percentage value to/from the 'Open' value, setting upper and lower bounds for our expected trading range.

- **Range Validation**:
  - A new column was created to validate whether the day's trading values (Open, Close, High, Low) fell within our calculated range. A value of 1 was assigned if all values were within bounds, indicating a successful prediction, and 0 otherwise.

- **Experimental Results**:
  - We experimented with different alpha values to adjust the range flexibility and observed the following probabilities for successful range predictions:
    - For alpha = 0.5, the probability of success was 0.65508.
    - For alpha = 1, the probability increased to 0.768717.
    - For alpha = 1.5, the probability further rose to 0.860963.

- **Conclusions**:
  - The results demonstrate a clear correlation between the alpha value and the probability of the day's trading values falling within our predicted range. As the alpha value increases, providing a wider range, the probability of encapsulating the trading values also increases.
  - This method provides a straightforward yet effective way to anticipate the trading range based on the previous day's average and the current day's opening value. It highlights the potential of historical data in enhancing the accuracy of market predictions.

- **Practical Implications**:
  - Traders and analysts can utilize this approach to set more informed stop-loss and take-profit levels, based on the calculated range probabilities.
  - The method offers a quantifiable means to assess daily market volatility and potential trading boundaries, aiding in risk management and trading strategy formulation.

This analysis underscores the value of leveraging historical market data and statistical techniques to forecast market behavior, presenting a valuable tool in the arsenal of traders and market analysts.
